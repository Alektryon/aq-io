Changes by @Alektryon, as of March 16, 2023:<br>
— Changed the default cipher from NAEQ (New Aeon English Qaballa) to AQ (Alphanumeric Qabbala): a continuous, non-redundant, alphanumeric sequence from 0 to Z=35.<br>
— Changed the database to my own, as I'm really not a fan of the database used in "naeq" (the same as in <a href="https://naeq.io/">NAEQ.io</a>), since most of its phrases don't seem to make sense. My database is <b>way</b> smaller (13K phrases instead of 86K), but in compensation, now all phrases in the database make sense.<br>

[March 21, 2023]<br>
— Reverted the database back to the original, while also including names & phrases from other databases. The database will be continuously expanded as time permits.<br>

[May 18, 2023]<br>
— All additions to the original database were cancelled. Now the database is exactly the same as the one in "NAEQ.io", except for a single entry that can't be found in the original database. In order to find out which one it is, simply type "666" in the input field — and you'll immediately understand what Alphanumeric Qabbala (AQ) is. ;)<br>
